A high demo success rate is not enough for production adoption.

For client projects, we evaluate three dimensions:

2. Stability under prompt drift and malformed inputs.
3. Cost-to-value across request volume and response quality.

When these are tracked together, teams can prioritize improvements that actually change business outcomes.
