Our new paper, **"Orcheo: A Modular Full-Stack Platform for Conversational Search,"** is now available on arXiv:

- [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14710](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14710)

The paper shows how Orcheo helps teams build and evolve conversational search systems as modular workflow graphs instead of brittle end-to-end scripts. It focuses on three practical outcomes:

- cleaner experiment iteration through component-level swaps,
- stronger reproducibility through explicit workflow structure, and
- a smoother path from local prototypes to production deployments.
